          React.js is a powerful JavaScript library developed by Facebook for
          building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, particularly
          single-page applications (SPAs). It follows a component-based
          architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI elements,
          making development more efficient and maintainable. React utilizes a
          virtual DOM for optimized rendering, ensuring better performance. It
          also supports state management through hooks like useState and
          useEffect, and can be integrated with libraries like Redux for complex
          state handling.
        </p>

          <h4>Key Features of React.js:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Component-Based Architecture - UI is broken into reusable
              components.
            </li>
            <li>Virtual DOM - Efficient updates and better performance.</li>
            <li>Declarative UI - Easy-to-read and maintainable code.</li>
            <li>
              State Management - Uses useState, useEffect, and external
              libraries like Redux or Zustand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hooks - Functional components with state and lifecycle management.
            </li>
          </ul>

          Next.js, built on top of React, is a popular framework designed to
          enhance React applications with features like server-side rendering
          (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), improving SEO and performance.
          It provides automatic code splitting, optimized image handling, and
          built-in API routes, making full-stack development easier. With its
          file-based routing system, Next.js simplifies navigation and improves
          scalability. While React is ideal for highly interactive SPAs, Next.js
          is the preferred choice for SEO-friendly and high-performance web
          applications, such as blogs, e-commerce sites, and enterprise-level
          dashboards.
        </p>
        <div>
          <h4>Key Features Of Next.js:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Server-Side Rendering (SSR) - Pre-render React components on the
              server and send the static HTML to the client.
            </li>
            <li>
              Static Site Generation (SSG) - Generate static HTML pages during
              build time, reducing server load and improving SEO.
            </li>
            <li>
              Automatic Code Splitting - Split code into smaller chunks based on
              routes, reducing initial bundle size and improving performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Image Optimization - Optimize images using tools like Sharp,
              Next/Image, and Next/Resize.
            </li>
            <li>
              API Routes - Create RESTful API endpoints using Next.js's built-in
              API routes.
            </li>
